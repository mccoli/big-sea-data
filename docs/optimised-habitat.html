        <h1>optimised habitat</h1>
        <p>In this sketch all the creatures have their own classes and methods. Having used classes before, the process of setting this up was fairly simple and I think improved performance greatly. The lag still eventually comes but it takes a lot longer to now. I also like that in a material way they have contained bodies now. I will be able to individually control their place in the scene, and how they navigate. The code is also a lot prettier and easy to manage. This is almost where I want it but I would like more creatures, more environmental landscape, more colour, and some interactivity (if time allows).</p>
